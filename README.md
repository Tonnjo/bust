# bust register tool

Utility for simply creating and modifying VHDL bus slave modules. bust does not refer to the hardware device!

## Concept

The main goal of the project is to able to automatically create and modify VHLD bus slave modules based on a simple definition format. By employing VHDL records the handling of the registers can be completely hidden in a module seperate from the rest of the designers logic. All referring to the registers are done via a record which specifies if the register is read-only or read-write, and also includes the name. All bus-specific signals are also wrapped in records. This increases the readability of the design as a whole.

## Bus support

bust currently supports these bus-types:

- AXI4-lite

## Requirements

bust is currently only tested with Python 3.5.2


## Getting Started

Install the latest relase by using pip (preferably pip3):

`pip3 install bust`


### Usage

`bust.py FILE [-o DIR]`

`bust.py -c FILE [-o DIR]`

`bust.py -e FILE [-o DIR]`

`bust.py --version`

`bust.py -h | --help`

### Output

The output VHDL files must be compiled with VHDL 2008.

## Latest Development Version (Bleeding Edge)

The latest development version can be found in the [dev branch](https://github.com/olagrottvik/bust/tree/dev) on Github. Clone the repo and checkout the branch.

`git clone https://github.com/olagrottvik/bust.git`

`cd bust`

`git checkout dev`

`pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

`python3 -m bust`

### Examples

The examples folder contain a JSON-file generated by the menu-system. This file is readable to the point that you can create your own from this template alone if you can't bothered with the menu-system. The folder also contain the output files generated based on the JSON-file.
